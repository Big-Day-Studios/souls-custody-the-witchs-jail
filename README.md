## About

<br/>

### The Game
"Souls Custody: The Witch's Jail" is the first game made by the group of indie game developers called "Big Day Studios". The game is tells the story of a 16 years girl called Rebecca. Rebecca has always had nightmares about an abandoned and 'haunted' store in her city. This store was built over of the ruins of an ancient underground construction. On an ordinary day, returning from her work, the young woman is the victim of attempted harassment, with the escape to shelter inside the store of her nightmares. And then, your soul leaves your body, causing it to enter the spiritual world. Devoid of her memories, Rebecca solves puzzles that lead to the release of the ghosts that she crosses on her way. Her goal is to recover your memories and get out of the haunted store, and to achieve that, she needs the lowest floor of the store.

## How to run it

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
